Introduction
The process in which a function calls itself is called recursion and the
corresponding function is called a recursive function.
Since computer programming is a fundamental application of mathematics, so let
us first try to understand the mathematical reasoning behind recursion.
In general, we all are aware of the concept of functions. In a nutshell, functions are
mathematical equations that produce an output on providing input. For example:
Suppose the function F(x) is a function defined by:
F(x) = x2 + 4
We can write the Python Code for this function as:
def F(int x):
return (x * x + 4)
Now, we can pass different values of x to this function and receive our output
accordingly.
Before moving onto the recursion, let's try to understand another mathematical
concept known as the Principle of Mathematical Induction (PMI).
