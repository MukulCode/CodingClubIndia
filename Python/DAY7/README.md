# DAY 7

### Question 1:

Given a non-negative integer x, compute and return the square root of x.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and 
only the integer part of the result is returned.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or 
operator, such as pow(x, 0.5) or x ** 0.5.

### Thought process:

- Couldn't think of idea at first
- Had to look at other solution and code binary search
