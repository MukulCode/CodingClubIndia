Just get started with a good Udemy course/ check out harvard's CS50 on YouTube for free!

Here are some tips from my side.
Choose your language.
Learn basics.
Learn the DSA. (Don't wait for completeion).
Learn some basic maths (hacker rank where you can start for maths and strengthen your coding concept).
Use codechef and leetcode. Attend all the contests and after contest upsolving and evaluation is a must.
And final and Last Practice !!!!!


I am adding some good links so it will help.

I prefer reading from books,so here are some

Let us c by yashwant kanetkar
test your C skills by yashwant kanetkar
data structures and algorithms by Reema thareja.
Java by herbert schildt
C by herbert schildt.
Lastly,I would say i have read a lot of books all through my learning stages but I what have realized that no knowledge is good for programming unless you code it. Unless you love debugging through your code trying what went wrong you can’t be good at it .So just give time!
