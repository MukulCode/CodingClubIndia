 like JavaScript,CPP,Kotlin and Python etc.

#) Then Just get started with a good course which have a full content🎯 about that, may be paid💸 or from free resources👨‍💻
Do check out harvard's CS50, love babbar{for DSA}, Coding shuttle by anuj bhayia{for web dev} on YouTube for free!!!
And yes, along with videos, make a habit of reading documents 📜📃as well.


#)Here are some tips from my side.

1: Choose your language.
2: Learn basics.
3: Learn the DSA. (Don't wait for completeion).
4: Learn some basic maths (hacker rank where you can start for maths and strengthen your coding concept).
5: Use codechef and leetcode. Attend all the contests and after contest upsolving and evaluation is a must.
6: Consistency makes a big difference though!!
