ðŸ”´HactoberFest Rules ðŸŽ¯ :

To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 70,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will be eligible to receive a prize.


Whether itâ€™s your first or fiftieth pull request, thereâ€™s always more to learn!!!, keep your repositories pristine, and build on your open source knowledge.
